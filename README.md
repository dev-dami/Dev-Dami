# Hi, I'm Damilare 👋

I'm a 17-year-old programmer from Nigeria who gets excited about making computers do exactly what I want them to do—whether that's building lightning-fast backend services or diving deep into how operating systems work under the hood.

## What I'm working on right now

I'm on a mission to master system-level programming, which means spending a lot of time with Rust and Go. There's something fascinating about working close to the metal and understanding how things actually work at the lowest levels. When I'm not exploring memory management and concurrency patterns, I'm building backend APIs with FastAPI, Node.js, and Elysia—the kind of infrastructure that needs to handle real-world scale and complexity.
I also believe in sharpening the saw daily, so you'll find me tackling algorithmic challenges on LeetCode and exploring data science problems on Kaggle.

**Systems & Performance:** C, Rust, Go  
**Application Development:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript  
**Web Technologies:** React, HTML, CSS  
**Backend Frameworks:** Node.js, Express, FastAPI, Elysia  
**Data Layer:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Firebase  
**Development Tools:** Neovim, VSCode, Git, Postman

## Let's connect

I'm always interested in connecting with other developers, especially those working on systems programming, backend architecture, or anyone who loves solving hard technical problems.
